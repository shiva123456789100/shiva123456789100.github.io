Its dying echoes, are the purest notes in the symphony of spacetime.”

Perturbed black holes emit gravitational waves at very specific complex frequencies before being stabilized into ground state. These characteristics complex frequencies are known as **Quasi-Normal Modes** of black hole. The signal is called **Ringdown** signal. Ringdown signal is very important to extract information about the black hole mass, charge , angular momentum.
