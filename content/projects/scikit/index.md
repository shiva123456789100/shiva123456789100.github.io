#  **The Dance of Shadows — Neutrino Oscillations**

Imagine a universe where even the faintest whispers of matter carry secrets —  
ghostly particles streaming through your body by the trillions every second,  
yet leaving no trace. These are **neutrinos**,  
the *phantoms* of the Standard Model,  
born in stars, reactors, and the early breath of the cosmos itself.

##  **Everything is mixed up**

Once thought massless and indifferent, neutrinos **change their identity** as they move —  
a ballet of quantum flavors: electron $(\nu_e)$, muon $(\nu_\mu)$, and tau $(\nu_\tau)$.  

This is called **neutrino oscillation**,  
a phenomenon that arises because **flavor states** are not the same as **mass states**.


## **Mystery Yet Unsolved**

Though we now know that neutrinos have **mass**,  
we do not yet know:
1.The **absolute mass scale** — only the differences.  
2. Whether the mass hierarchy is **normal** or **inverted**.  
3. If neutrinos are their own antiparticles — **Majorana or Dirac?**  
4. Whether they hide a hint of **CP violation**  
  that shaped the universe’s preference for matter over antimatter.

##  **My Project**

In my project , I explored mechanisms of neutrino oscillation and various state-of-the-art experiments going on round the world to decipher the mystery of the mysterious mesmerizing neutrinos.
