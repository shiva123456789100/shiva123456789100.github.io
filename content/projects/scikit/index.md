#  **The Dance of Shadows — Neutrino Oscillations**

Imagine a universe where even the faintest whispers of matter carry secrets —  
ghostly particles streaming through your body by the trillions every second,  
yet leaving no trace. These are **neutrinos**,  
the *phantoms* of the Standard Model,  
born in stars, reactors, and the early breath of the cosmos itself.

##  **My Project**

In my project , I explored mechanisms of neutrino oscillation and various state-of-the-art experiments going on round the world to decipher the mystery of the mysterious mesmerizing neutrinos.
