"Have u heard the birthcry of cosmos? 
Not of light, but of trembling spacetime itself —
the faint ripple of creation, echoing across eons,
carrying the memory of colliding stars,
of black holes entwined in their final dance."

Fascinated by the universe as a canvas of twinkle twinkle little stars? Ask me,  I see the universe as a living, breathing fabric one that stretches,trembles and remembers. Hard to believe, na?
I’d love to share how a physics student looks at the cosmos — through the language of spacetime, waves, and wonder — with physicists and non-science friends alike.
