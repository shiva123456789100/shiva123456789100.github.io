👋 Welcome to the  world of amplitude. Ready to learn more?

<!--more-->

This page is my point of view how a student at my current understanding level (final/pre-final year undergrad physics) can get hold of concepts in QFT and amplitudes better. QFT is such a field where for the first time I felt even more than knowing and grasping something new , it is important to understand how to delve into a completely unfamiliar domain i.e. How to choose 'MY' book, how to prepare 'MY' notes, what to study next, what things to "skip" for the first reading and what is a **must**. The different approaches taken by different QFT books had made the job so difficult for me.  

I am posting my personal guideline for a newcomer in QFT or amplitudes. I wish someone would have told me when I was starting my journey with QFT.
