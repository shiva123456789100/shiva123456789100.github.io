title: "Amplitudes: Prerequisites and foundations"

---

Before starting to explore scattering amplitude-based techniques, you should be not only familiar but also **comfortable** with concepts and computations in  
1. Feynman-diagrammatic techniques and computations of $\mathcal{M}$ matrix
2.Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) — the time-tested jewel of QFT, and the theory in which our confidence shines the brightest.
3. Non-abelian gauge theory. (YM theory) . Exposure to gluon amplitudes is very useful, as perturbative quantum gravity is inspired from YM.

These concepts you can easily find in any book on introductory QFT. But, again be-aware the approaches will be very different to discuss the same material. 

Once, you have the pre-requisites, the next hurdle is **Spinor-Helicity formalism** which is  **AK-47 of modern amplitude war**.

I would recommend if you study this part from a particular book , you may feel lost. So, refer to modern literature-review and make use of recorded youTube lectures of seminars. "Amplitudes" conference lectures had been psoted in youTube, since 2020. These are really good lectures to start with. I found the following lectures very intriguing. These covers from basics of amplitude compuatation to various applications of it.
