Before starting to explore scattering amplitude-based techniques, you should be not only familiar but also **comfortable** with concepts and computations in  
1. Feynman-diagrammatic techniques and computations of $\mathcal{M}$ matrix
2.Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) — the time-tested jewel of QFT, and the theory in which our confidence shines the brightest.
3. Non-abelian gauge theory. (YM theory) . Exposure to gluon amplitudes is very useful, as perturbative quantum gravity is inspired from YM.

These concepts you can easily find in any book on introductory QFT. But, again be-aware the approaches will be very different to discuss the same material. 

Once, you have the pre-requisites, the next hurdle is **Spinor-Helicity formalism** which is  **AK-47 of modern amplitude war**.

I would recommend if you study this part from a particular book , you may feel lost. So, refer to modern literature-review and make use of recorded youTube lectures of seminars. "Amplitudes" conference lectures had been psoted in youTube, since 2020. These are really good lectures to start with. I found the following lectures very intriguing. These covers from basics of amplitude compuatation to various applications of it.

1.**Basics of Scattering Amplitudes: Amplitude Games 2021** by **Prof. Henriette Elvang**[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_pqsOYMHP4&list=PLejkXpUan6WEqle5MQttuFK2_TWzJSUNw)
2.**Scattering Amplitudes and Gravitational Waves: Young Frontiers Meeting at ICTP-SAIFR** by **Julio Parra-Martínez** [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsK8YvxdvB4&t=8s)
3.**Amplitudes and Observables: IAS Summer school 2024** by **Prof. Donal O' Connell** [click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEeohfsC_0)
4.**Introduction to Scattering Amplitudes:SAGEX Network** by **Professor Johannes Henn**[click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vxBqoHlDuM)

I will keep posting lecture series I find interesting and I understand. If you find something cool , just let me know. I will post it here.
