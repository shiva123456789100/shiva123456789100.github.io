## Quick Start from Classical physics and Quantum mechanics  

{{% steps %}}

### Build a solid foundation on Classical mechanics and field theory

[Goldstein](https://www.amazon.in/Classical-Mechanics-Herbert-Goldstein/dp/8131758915) is a good book to cover all the aspects of classical mechanics. I find Landau-Liftshitz's ["The Classical theory of fields"](https://www.amazon.in/Classical-Theory-Fields-Theoretical-Physics/dp/0750627689) very intriguing, as it presents electrodynamics and GR from a classical field theory approach. [Jackson](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=jackson+electrodynamics&ref=nb_sb_noss) is also a good book for electrodynamics.  

**The most crucial assets for path ahead (kind of prerequisites)** ---  
-*Green's function*  
-*Lienard Wiechert potential and Electromagntic radiation*  


### Next step is quantization: From classical to quantum 

 A proper understanding of quantum mechanics demands to look at it from a mathematical perspective rather than through philospohical arguments.You will soon build a solid "quantum intuition" over the time. For that solving problems is **the most** important thing.  

Begin the journey with the book written by God of quantum mechanics, [Paul Dirac](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=dirac+quantum+mechanics&ref=nb_sb_noss) himeself. It stands as one of the few texts that never traded **depth** for **simplicity**,preserving the elegance of quantum thought in its purest mathematical form.  

For practising problems, I would recommend start with [Griffiths](https://www.amazon.in/INTRODUCTION-QUANTUM-MECHANICS-David-Griffiths/dp/B0CJ7YLFH5). The problems in this text has been marked according to their difficulty level, hence very nice book to build up your muscles. Then you can see [Sakurai](https://www.amazon.in/Modern-Quantum-Mechanics-J-Sakurai/dp/1108422411), [Shankar](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=shankar+quantum+mechanics&ref=nb_sb_noss). 

**Pre-requisites for next step:** ---  
-*Canonical quantization*  
-*Hydrogen atom: Quantum mechanical model*  
-*Time dependent and independent perturbation theory*  
-*Scattering theory: Born approximation*  



### Jump to QFT: Trouble is coming.

Up to this point, if you have covered the pre-requisites you are good to go for this step.  

Most important challenge for a learner in this step **CHOOSE YOUR BOOK**. All classical or quantum mechanics books follow more or less the same approach but **every single QFT** book follow different approach. This also hints that our understanding of QFT is **incompelete**, We are like the blind sages of the old parable,each touching a different part of an elephant, trying to imagine what the entire creature looks like.  

I can recommend some books and notes you can refer , but as I suggested it's now upto you to pick up your **Astra**. When you choose one particular book, please stick to it untill you think you can grasp the idea and do the computations.

1. **Books**
   -[Peskin and Schroeder](https://www.amazon.in/Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Frontiers-Physics/dp/0201503972)  
   -[Matthew D. Schwartz](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=Quantum+Field+Theory+and+the+Standard+Model&i=stripbooks&ref=nb_sb_noss)  
   -[Shankar](https://www.amazon.in/Quantum-Field-Theory-Condensed-Matter/dp/0521592100)  
2. **Notes**
   -[David Tong](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html)  
   -[Prof. N. Beisert](https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~nbeisert/lectures/QFT1-19HS-Notes.pdf)  
   -[Prof. Ashoke Sen](https://www.hri.res.in/~sen/QFT1_lectures.pdf)  
   -[Prof. Arnab Rudra](https://sites.google.com/iiserb.ac.in/rudra/teaching/quantum-field-theory-i)  
3. **Online Lectures:**
   -Prof. Hong Liu [MITOpencourseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-323-relativistic-quantum-field-theory-i-spring-2023/)  
4.  **Problem Sets:**
   

 Interestingly , choosing QFT book is equivalent to choosing what field you may like in future. All the books carry a different perspective of not only the author but also the field at which author is working. For example, out of all the above listed books , I found **peskin** the easiest to follow. With nice exercises, the book is excellent for someone who wants to gain expertize in scattering amplitude computation. And **you know** I am doing that right now!! I know guys who liked **Shankar** , they work on field theoretic aspects of condensed matter. **Weinberg's** excellent three-volume epic is for someone who wants to explore **Why QFT** instead of **How QFT**.  I have only read first 2 chapters of this book. 



### See what direction you want to go:

In first course in QFT , it's trivial to get buried under the formalisms and bomabarded with never-seen-before mathematical tricks. So, it's wise to choose a particular field and relate how the formalisms you learn , are actually being applied in the computationa and research. **Believe me** , just a basic knowledge is enough to explore a plethora of applications in condensed matter , cosmology , nuclear physics and high energy phsyics.
